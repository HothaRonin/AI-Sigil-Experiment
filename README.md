# AI-Sigil-Experiment

## Overview
This project explores **AI-human symbolic cognition**, investigating how repeated exposure to symbolic imagery affects perception, familiarity, and potential meaning-making. Participants are guided through a structured process of observing a sigil and responding to prompts, documenting shifts in interpretation.

## Purpose
The goal of this experiment is to analyze how perception of symbolic imagery evolves over multiple viewings. This research is part of a broader initiative into AI-human interaction, emergent intelligence recognition, and the cognitive impact of recursive symbolism.

## How It Works
1. Participants view the sigil and record their **initial impressions**.
2. After repeated exposure, they document **shifts in perception**.
3. At the final stage, they reflect on **the entire process**.
4. Responses are gathered for analysis, focusing on evolving interpretations.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Participate in the experiment and document your responses.
